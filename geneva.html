  <br><br>
  <strong>Geneva</strong> is the second-most populous city in <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">Switzerland</a></u> (after Zürich) and the most populous city of Romandy, the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Situated where the Rhône exits Lake Geneva, it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva.
  <br><br>
  <h2>Name</h2>
  <p>The city was mentioned in Latin texts, by Caesar, with the spelling Genava, probably from the Celtic *genawa- from the stem *genu- ("bend, knee"), in the sense of a bending river or estuary, an etymology shared with Italian port city of Genoa (in Italian Genova).</p>
  <p style="margin-top:10px;">The medieval county of Geneva in Middle Latin was known as pagus major Genevensis or Comitatus Genevensis (also Gebennensis). After 1400, it became the Genevois province of Savoy (albeit not extending to the city proper, until the reformation of the seat of the Bishop of Geneva).</p>
