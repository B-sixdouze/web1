  <p><strong>Zürich</strong> is the largest city in <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">Switzerland</a></u>, and the capital of the canton of Zürich. It is located in north-central Switzerland, at the northwestern tip of Lake Zürich. As of January 2020, the municipality has 434,335 inhabitants, the urban area (agglomeration) 1.315 million (2009), and the Zürich metropolitan area 1.83 million (2011). Zürich is a hub for railways, roads, and air traffic. Both Zurich Airport and railway station are the largest and busiest in the country.</p>
  <p>Permanently settled for over 2,000 years, Zürich was founded by the Romans, who, in 15BC, called it Turicum. However, early settlements have been founded dating back more than 6,400 years (although this only indicates human presence of a town that early). During the Middle Ages, Zürich gained the independent and privileged status of imperial immediacy and, in 1519, became a primary centre of the Protestant Reformation in Europe under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli.</p>
  <p>The official language of Zürich is German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Zürich German.</p>
